---------------------

  This year the team was one man army:

  Einar Lielmanis <einar@spicausis.lv>


This is a ICFP-2012 boulder-dash solution written in OCaml.

The solver is a small heuristics-based solution searcher; for each location
only the heurestest of the paths is retained and analyzed further in depth.

The heuristic is a magic based on robots excitement of the path. Did it
move a rock? Exciting! Dit it get a razor? Doubly so!

While solver is unable to solve larger maps, but should cope with them fairly
robustly, not eating too much memory, etc.


Invocations
-----------

1. The official, contest invocation:

  ./loader <some.map

2a. Solve map and animate the solution:

  ./loader some.map

2b. Solve map and just display the solution and final state:

  QUIET=1 ./loader some.map

3a. Run some solution (e.g RLUDRLUD) on a map and display the progress:

  ./loader some.map RLUDRLUD

3b. Run some solution on a map and display the end state:

  QUIET=1 ./loader some.map RLUDRLUD



Compilation from source
-----------------------

To compile you will need:

  ocaml ocaml-findlib ocaml-extlib

For debian the packages are called:

  ocaml-nox ocaml-findlib libextlib-ocaml-dev

After that, "make" in src folder will build a nice solver.
